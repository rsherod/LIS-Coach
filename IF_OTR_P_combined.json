        "short": "Precorrection is a preventative behavior strategy used to identify predictable context in which problem behavior often occurs. It is the providing of students with prompts, supports, and reinforcement for engaging in appropriate behavior.",
        "detailed": "Precorrection is a proactive strategy that helps solve everyday problems with a simple and minimal amount of planning. By \"getting in front\" of disruptive behaviors that are predictable or readily anticipated, teachers and staff reduce or eliminate the likeliness of a problem behavior occurring. A little preplanning with the preventative strategy of precorrection means problem behaviors are dealt with before they occur, instead of reacting to them after they occur."
      },
      "components": "Precorrection includes visual supports (e.g., setting expectation posters) and verbal prompts delivered shortly before a problem behavior is anticipated in the authentic setting where it usually occurs, followed by strong reinforcement for engaging in appropriate behavior. This strategy has great flexibility and is usable in virtually any setting with any group of students, easily adapted to any activity or subject area where problem behaviors are anticipated.",
      "tieredUse": "Precorrection is an easy-to-use, antecedent-based strategy. It can be used: (1) as a Tier 1 strategy during instruction, to facilitate transitions, and even in a range of non-instructional settings; (2) used as a Tier 2 intervention, embedded with other Tier 2 interventions; or (3) added as a component of a Tier 3 intervention for students in need of additional supports.",

          "content": "As an illustration, picture a teacher presenting a new concept to the whole class. She provides an anticipatory set (e.g., advanced organizer or lesson hook), activates prior knowledge, states the learning objectives, introduces the concept, models it, checks for understanding, does some guided practice, and provides clear directions for independent practice so students can increase fluency with the new concept. These students will need immediate feedback as they begin independent work, feedback that will confirm what they are doing is correct and encourage them to continue and try harder concepts, and/or feedback that will fine-tune their understanding and correct mistakes before incorrect procedures and habits are solidified. The teacher provides this instructional feedback while actively supervising independent work (as opposed to on a final assessment), facilitating high levels of accuracy."
