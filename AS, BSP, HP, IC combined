              "definition": "Active supervision can be used as a low-intensity, teacher-delivered strategy to support students meeting behavior by frequently and proactively monitoring students during specific settings or times. Active supervision is defined as the use of 'Specific and overt behaviors (scanning, escorting, interacting) designed to prevent problem behavior and promote rule-following behavior' (Colvin, Sugai, Good, & Lee, 1997, p. 346).",
              "effectiveness": "Its effectiveness is increased with the use of precorrections (Lane, Menzies, Ennis, & Oakes, 2005).",

                  "While the activity ensues, the adult moves around the setting scanning and monitoring.",
                  "The adult uses proximity to signal students they are alert and monitoring (e.g., precorrections, non-verbal prompts).",
