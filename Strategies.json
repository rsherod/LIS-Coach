    "Guiding Questions": {
      "Why is Active Supervision effective?": [
        "Active supervision is a proactive strategy that aims to prevent challenging behavior before it occurs.",
        "It communicates to the students that the adults are aware of what they are doing."

      "What are the challenges of Active Supervision?": [

    "Steps": [
      "1. Identify the activity or transition period that would benefit most from active supervision.",
      "2. Ensure that the routine for the target activity is familiar and understood by students. If not, routines and expectations must be established.",
      "3. Provide the cue or prompt to begin the activity.",
      "4. As the activity unfolds, scan and monitor the area.",
      "5. Signal your awareness of students' actions through proximity, prompts, and non-verbal communication.",
